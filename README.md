## 🧠 About the Project

### 🎯 Objective

To design and develop a responsive web dashboard that visualizes India's advancement on the **17 UN SDGs** using national and state-wise performance indicators provided by **NITI Aayog** and **UNDP**.

### 🔍 Problem Addressed

Lack of a central, accessible, and interactive platform for tracking India's SDG performance across states. This leads to poor awareness and weak citizen engagement with the 2030 Agenda.
